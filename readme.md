# THe Randolph Times
Hey all!
This is the website that used to hold all the articles from the Randolph Times, the official newspaper for A. Philip Randolph Campus
High School in Manhattan, New York. The theme we used here is a theme that was created for another newspaper, the Binghamtom University Pipedream
THe theme was created by Daniel O' Connor, and it was modified by me to fit my former high school's needs.

If you need any help setting up the theme please contact me at fernflore20@gmail.com
